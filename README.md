# jQuery Plugins
* [Simple Text Rotator](http://www.vickigrunewald.com/project_resume/): Animates/rotates text via a list of words you wish to scroll through. You can find this plugin used in my website header - I'm using it to rotate through my interests: Web Design, Custom Graphics and Original Branding. Using this plugin, these words fade in and out, one after the other. 
* [Woco Accordion](https://github.com/chooowai/woco-accordion): This plugin creates a fluid accordion layout with subtle sliding animation. The accordion makes up the body of my website, with each "drawer" holding a section of my resume content.

# Comments
* I think this project turned out well - I look forward to receiving your feedback! I'm not sure if this is an issue or not, but the accordion plugin did not appear to easily incorporate HTML5 elements - instead of divs, I think section/article elements would have been more appropriate. I did edit the plugin's JS file a little to reflect appropriate heading heirarchy. Regardless, my resume website does pass the validator and outliner tests. Thank you!
